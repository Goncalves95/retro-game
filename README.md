# [Marios Reboot](https://vcgithubcode.github.io/retro-game/)

![Project Title](/assets/images/title.webp)

## Introduction

Our mission for this project was to celebrate the great pixel games of old.
We would do this by giving the user the chance to relive play a version of the most favourite pixel game out of all of them in Super Mario.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

We've used CSS for the colours and used colours from the original super mario game to make it feel authentic.

we've used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/000000-049cd8-fbd000-e52521-43b047) to generate our colour palette.

### Typography

This was borrowed from the original super mario retro theme.

## User Stories

### Landing Page

- As a user, I should be able to figure out what a site is about in 7 seconds.

## Wireframes

To follow best practices, wireframes were developed to help with development.
We've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design our site wireframes.
